## Sources:
* Used ratings from the provided IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes data sets

# 1. Top 5 Genres

Using the IMDB data base, I found the top 5 genres in the US to be Biography, History, Music, Sports and Drama.
The results were surprising as I feel the majority of movies were all action and zombie films.
Perhaps most viewers do not share the same tastes as me.

# 2. Effect of Runtime on Ratings

The highest rated films in the top genres are clustered around short (less than 90 minutes)
and long (greater than 110 minutes)

I believe the clear winner here are films with run times less than 90.

# 3. Keywords
